## Getting and Cleaning Data Class Project

All of the required transformations needed to produce the tidy dataset are
performed using a single script: `run_analysis.R`. The script will take all
data from the dataset folder (assuming it is loaded as your working directory)
and produce the final tidy output required in the class project instructions.

For details on the data files, variables, and description of what the script is
doing please see the Code Book included in this repo.
